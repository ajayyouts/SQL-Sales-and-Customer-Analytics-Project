# Customer Analytics SQL Project

This project demonstrates my ability to conduct comprehensive business data analysis using SQL.
The goal was to analyze a simulated transactional database for a fictional bike shop, generating insights about customer behavior, sales performance, and product category trends. 

## Objectives

- Explore database schema and relationships
- Analyze sales and customer data to identify key performance metrics
- Segment customers to uncover purchasing trends
- Quantify product and category performance

## Key Analyses Performed

- **Database Exploration:** Reviewed schema, tables, and relationships
- **Sales Performance:** Total sales, order counts, revenue by category, top products
- **Customer Insights:** Repeat purchase behavior, high-value customers, segmentation
- **Trends Over Time:** Monthly sales trends, cumulative revenue, YoY comparisons
- **Category & Product Mix:** Profit contribution by category, part-to-whole analysis
- **Benchmarks:** Average order value, regional performance

## Data Preparation

- Connected to the transactional database using SQL Server
- Verified table relationships and primary/foreign keys
- Ensured correct data types for dates, currency, and categorical fields
- Used CTEs and window functions for advanced calculations

## Sample Outputs

## Tools & Techniques

- Microsoft SQL Server / SSMS  
- SQL techniques: Joins, GROUP BY, Window Functions (LAG, ROW_NUMBER), Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Aggregations, CASE statements

## Why It Matters

This project simulates real-world business analytics workflows: extracting, analyzing, and synthesizing insights from a transactional database for a fictional bike shop.
It demonstrates my readiness for junior business analyst roles, with an emphasis on SQL technical skills, analytical thinking, and business-focused decision-making.
