# Customer Analytics SQL Project

This project demonstrates my ability to conduct comprehensive business data analysis using SQL.
The goal was to analyze a simulated transactional database for a fictional bike shop, generating insights about customer behavior, sales performance, and product category trends. 

* Analyses Performed

- Database & schema exploration  
- Dimensions, dates, and measures analysis  
- Magnitude & ranking analysis  
- Change-over-time & cumulative trends  
- Performance metrics & benchmarks  
- Part-to-whole analysis  
- Data segmentation  
- Final consolidated customer report synthesis

* Tools & Techniques

- Microsoft SQL Server / SSMS  
- SQL techniques: Joins, GROUP BY, Window Functions (LAG, ROW_NUMBER), Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Aggregations, CASE statements

* Why It Matters


This project simulates real-world business analytics workflows: extracting, analyzing, and synthesizing insights from a transactional database for a fictional bike shop.
It demonstrates my readiness for junior business analyst roles, with an emphasis on SQL technical skills, analytical thinking, and business-focused decision-making.
